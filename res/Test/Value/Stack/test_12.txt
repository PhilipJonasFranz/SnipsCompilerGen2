DESCRIPTION
This test aims to verify the correct functionality of assignments to read and write from
and to the stack.
SOURCE
int main(int a, int b) {
	int b0 = a + b;
	int b1 = a + b + 1;
	int b2 = a + b + 2;
	int b3 = a + b + 3;
	int b4 = a + b + 4;
	int b5 = a + b + 5;
	int b6 = a + b + 6;
	int b7 = a + b + 7;
	int b8 = a + b + 8;
	int b9 = a + b;
	
	b9 = a + b9;
	b8 = 8;
	
	return b8 + b9;
