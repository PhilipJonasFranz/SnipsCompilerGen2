# Snips Compiler Gen.2 v.0.0.1-DEVELOP
## What is Snips?
 Snips is a C/Java oriented proramming language. This brings familiar programming concepts to the table,
 like functions, conditionals, loops, arrays, global variables and a wide roster of built in operators, 
 as well as support for functionality like recursion. 
 Currently supported data types are Integers and Booleans, as well as multi-dimensional arrays of them.
 Currently supported statement structures are if, if-else, else, while, do-while, for, switch, break, 
 continue and return.
