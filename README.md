# Snips Compiler Gen.2 v.1.0.0-RELEASE
## What is Snips?
 Snips is a lightweight C/Java oriented proramming language. This brings familiar programming concepts to 
 the table, like functions, conditionals, loops, arrays, global variables and a wide roster of built in 
 operators, as well as support for functionality like recursion. 
 Currently supported data types are Integers and Booleans, as well as multi-dimensional arrays of said 
 types.
 Currently supported statement structures are if, if-else, else, while, do-while, for, switch, break, 
 continue and return.
